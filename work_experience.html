										<h2>Aspire Systems (Formerly known as RapidValue Solutions)</h2>
										<p>May, 2018 - July, 2022 </p>
									</header>
									<p>During my tenure at Aspire systems, I had the privilege of being a vital part of an agile team for a client based in Texas, 
										working on a Loan Origination System (LOS) for a fin-tech client. My role encompassed diverse responsibilities, 
										from integrating multiple fin-tech APIs, including those from providers such as Jack Henry, RiskTheory, and Experian, to actively 
										contributing to the development and authorship of migration scripts and stored procedures. Moreover, I gained 
										extensive practical experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS), specializing in services such as SQS, Lambda, S3, 
										EC2, and DynamoDB. </br></br>
										Notably, I played a crucial role in the development of automation, integration, and comprehensive 
										unit test cases, which were instrumental in ensuring the robustness of various application features. </br>
										I was also a pretty good support engineer, where I addressed and resolved system bugs, involving in-depth code debugging and regular 
										client interactions to expedite issue resolution. </br></br>
										Throughout this project, I adhered to agile development methodologies, actively participating in daily client meetings. 
										I took a proactive approach in story grooming and pointing, ensuring a clear understanding of project requirements. Additionally, 
										I had the privilege of representing my team while conducting client demos, effectively showcasing the progress and outcomes of our development efforts. 
										This experience profoundly enriched my skills and insights in software development and project management.

											<h2>Peer Research Intern, University of Sheffield</h2>
											<p>March, 2023 - April, 2023 </p>
										</header>
										<p>During my tenure as a peer researcher with the Universityâ€™s employability team, I represented the Information school 
										and conducted a study aimed at optimizing the use of career services amongst the students of the department to elevate 
										their employability prospects.</br> I initiated the project by meticulously formulating surveys that were tailored to the 
										needs of the diverse students in the department which was then handed out to these students. I leveraged my analytical 
										skills to process and extract meaningful insights from the accumulated data which I did via SPSS.</br> I then compiled a 
										comprehensive report detailing my findings and presented a clear and evidence-based roadmap for enhancing the effectiveness 
										of our university's career services. This experience underscored my proficiency in research, data analysis, and my ability 
										to translate data-driven insights into actionable strategies, all of which are pivotal in my journey as a data scientist.
